   <br> In the immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr, “Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education”, and I could not be prouder in the fact that here in St. Francis’ College we have been, all through the highly halcyon 134 years of our establishment, never failed to imbibe the same spirit in an individual. Think of the most grandiloquent pathway of life or the most humble one, and you will surely find a certain cluster of well distinguished gentlemen, all of whom would commit to the tunes of “We will answer when duty shall call.”, with all their heart. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what the Franciscan way of life is all about. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what the Franciscan spirit is all about.
   <br>
   <br>Almost fourteen years now into my own Franciscan journey, I have not only witnessed but also experienced the wonders which this institution does in truly nurturing an individual. Each and every one of its sanguine bricks act as a stepping stone for the students, thus augmenting each and every one of their qualities, be it their academical prowess in securing a great percentage and acing in competitive exams like JEE,NEET and CLAT, their versatility on the stage in national level debates, quizzes and skits or for that matter, their indefatigable efforts in securing laurels in national level events as a part of the various sports teams consistently. By taking this holistic approach towards the development of a young mind, a Franciscan’s sphere of excellence is thus widened to an unfathomable extent, hence giving us the edge over the rest in the outside world.

<br>After the investiture ceremony this morning, I could hear the words of Niccolo Machiavelli softly ringing in my head, “It is not titles that honor men but men that honor titles.” Growing up as a Franciscan, I have been under the guidance of perhaps the best set of teachers in the country and along the journey looked up to my seniors, seniors who once stood at the same pedestal where I stand today, for learning the Franciscan way of getting things done.I hope to make them proud and successfully discharge all my duties as the college captain for this academic session. I have no doubt that by the end of the session, my fellow Franciscans, staying true to our tradition, we shall once again conquer unexplored heights and further our vision of Franciscan glory, together.
<br>
<br>Pax-et Bonum<br>
