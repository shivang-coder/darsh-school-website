   <br> St. Francis College is a renowned and prestigious institution of the city of Lucknow and I feel extremely happy and privileged to be part of this magnificent educational institution. I gratefully acknowledge the yeoman service of my Predecessors, dedicated Teachers & Staff and ever supporting parents and well wishers of Franciscan fraternity. May God be gracious to you all for your noble contribution towards the institution and nation building.
   <br>
   <br>Today we are living in a fast changing complex society, which presents before us challenges as well as opportunities. In this context it all depends on every individual how one responds to the situation with the right mindset. I remember the words of Benjamin Disraeli, “Nurture your mind with great thoughts, for you will never go any higher than you think.” Indeed, we need better education to have better thoughts, to be better human persons, to build a better society. I firmly believe that every human being endowed with various talents and skills is a precious gift of God. I am very pleased to bring to your notice that St. Francis College is one of those Colleges which provides ample opportunities along with a value based wholesome quality education to nurture the inner potentials of every child.
   <br>
   <br>I wish and pray that everyday be a special day for every child who enters the portals of St. Francis College, with a heart and mind set to grow more than yesterday. The following lines of John L. Mason are worth pondering,
    <br>
    <br>“…Do more than grow. Bloom.<br>
    <br>Do more than hear. Listen.<br>
    <br>Do more than talk. Communicate.<br>
    <br>Do more than think. Create.<br>
    <br> Do more than work. Excel.<br>
    <br> Do more than decide. Discern.<br>
    <br>Do more than read. Apply.<br>
    <br> Do more than dream. Do<br>
    <br>  Do more than wish. Believe.<br>
    <br>  Do more than change. Improve.<br>
    <br>  Do more than exist. Live.”<br>
    <br>  And Live with a purpose in your heart. May the prayer of St. Francis, ‘Make me a channel of your peace’ be the guiding force and may the blessing of the Almighty God be with you all for a successful academic year.
    <br>
    <br> Pax et Bonum!<br>
