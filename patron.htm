<br>PATRON<br>
<br>St. Francis Of Assisi, Our Patron<br>
<br>He discarded his fine clothes and wore rough clothes and plain leather <br>strap sandals. He then begged for stones to repair the church.<br> To raise funds, he sold his favourite horse, Raphael, his flute and<br> clothes that had been stitched for his wedding. He continued to work <br>hard depriving himself of food and sleep. In 1220, he founded two <br>Orders, Order of Friars Minor, his first order and Order of the Poor<br> Ladies, his second order. He got the approval of Pope Innocent III for <br>12 Brothers Minor to work in God’s vineyard. St. Francis was known <br>for his love and concern for animals. He always attended to any creature <br>that needed help and these creatures reciprocated his love. At Gubbio,<br> he tamed a ferocious wolf that killed children. This wolf, now <br>followed him like a puppy, and sat at his feet. On another occasion,<br> swallows kept chattering and disturbing him. They stopped their <br>chatter when St. Francis said, ” My little sisters, the swallows, it <br>is now time to speak. Now listen to the word of God and be quiet” <br>.On 4th October 1226, God called Francis to his eternal reward. His <br>untiring efforts to work in Christ’s vineyard were not left unrewarded. <br>In 1228, he was declared a Saint. Many later Saints were inspired<br> by St. Francis of Assisi. We celebrate the patrons day every <br>year on 4th October.<br>

<br>St. Francis of Assisi was the son of a rich merchant, Pietro Bernardone <br>d lady Pica. His childhood was rather a happy one. He loved to sing.<br> Once he sang to Lady Ortotena and received in return a precious dragon-shaped ring.<br> When he was just seven, he realised the obligation to protect the<br> ladies of his house and accompanied them to the market. As Francis <br>grew up, he showed signs that he was God’s chosen one. He fed the<br> poor and hungry people and animals with the money he obtained from his<br> mother. So deep was his concern for lepers that he was not averse to <br>embrace them. On one occasion, he disappeared from a party and was <br>finally found in deep thought. When questioned, he made it known to<br> them about his intention of adopting a life of poverty. One day,<br> Francis was praying at the ruined church before a crucifix. While <br>he was deeply engrossed in prayer, oblivious of everything around him,<br> he heard a voice telling him, “Go Francis and repair my church,<br> which you see is falling into ruin”. When he heard a definite call<br> from Christ, he did not waver.<br>
