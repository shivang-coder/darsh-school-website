  <br>  We cannot always built the future for your youth, but we can built our youth for the future,”- Franklin D. Roosevelt.
  <br>
  <br>In the dawning of an era where parenting is merely an extension of submission to a kid’s demands, you might believe that makes the little one happy. By that, you believe to conceal your own guilt of compensation with money for time. Parenting is not merely supporting the growth of a child but to have active participation in the growth. There is no way we can prepare tomorrow to suit our kind’s requirements, but we can surely modify our kids today, to prepare them for their tomorrow. Here’s what, if you teach your child once, it will remain as a legacy with them and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>Discipline is inevitable and this your child should know. All notorious and fun deeds apart, you should never compromise with the discipline, or maybe then be prepared to bear the brunt of it long after they are adults and beyond, if they refuse to take commands for their discipline, they are obliged to take command for their punishment.
  <br>
  <br>Win with humility and to lose with grace, and if your child’s a foul loser-try and point out where he went wrong. Most often than not parents are overpowering with their quest for their child to ace and often end up making the child a foul loser. It is mandatory for you to instill in kid’s minds that winning and losing has to happens and that you would appreciate the efforts even if they lose. Even when your child wins, make it a point to walk up to who didn’t win and congratulate them for the effort. Your child often tends to be scared of being reprimanded on losing and that makes them foul losers. A habit children often pick up is to lie and be dishonest, but the most morally important life lesson you need to teach them without fail is to learn to be honest, no matter what the consequences. They might have been dishonest for good, but they need to know that dishonesty is not good.
  <br>
  <br>Children today, in their abundance of materialism seem to lose out on the basic human quality, like charity. If your child has begun to look down on the poor and does not donate readily to them, it is the time you realize that sensitivity is losing out on him. He needs to know, the life of living with little to help others, gain a life of more.
  <br>
  <br>Negativity can not only tarnish you child’s image with others but will sooner or later lead him to self-destruction too, hence it is the indispensible duty of a parent to make the child see the bad in himself and thereby realize the good in others, and not play the blame game and own up to the mistakes he has made, no matter what the consequences. Owning up to mistake is almost half undoing it.
  <br>
  <br>Punctuality and hard work are the biggest virtues and milestones to success. However they don’t come on their own. Set them a target and once they achieve it, they may get a reward of their choice. This is a guaranteed way of getting your child to be on time and to work hard too. You need to teach a child to fear God, to respect all and believe in love. Respecting people automatically reduces all other vices from their view of you. Being God fearing automatically inculcates in you all virtues, for you know you’d be punished for the vices. Loving one and all will make you believe in the unity of mankind and to be optimistic about yourself and the world.
